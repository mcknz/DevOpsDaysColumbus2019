This repo contains supporting material for the "Automating Your Automation: The Care and Feeding of Jenkins" session presented by Jeff McKenzie at the Devopsdays Columbus 2019 conference on September 18, 2019 in Columbus, Ohio.

## DevpsDays
Devopsdays is a worldwide series of technical conferences covering topics of software development, IT infrastructure operations, and the intersection between them. Each event is run by volunteers from the local area.

Most devopsdays events feature a combination of curated talks (see open Calls for Proposals) and self organized open space content. Topics often include automation, testing, security, and organizational culture.

## Automating Your Automation: The Care and Feeding of Jenkins
If you’re like 70% of continuous integration and delivery users out there, you’re using Jenkins, the powerful and popular automation server. Jenkins runs on many different operating systems, and can build and deploy applications in a variety of languages, across many different platforms. Almost no matter where you are in your automation maturity, there’s always another level to reach: if you’re using the basic point-and-click of freestyle jobs, you can move to the scripted context of pipelines. Once you’ve explored pipelines, you can learn to leverage shared global libraries to promote code reuse across multiple pipelines. In this session, you’ll learn basics about Jenkins, specific use cases for different job types, and how best to manage your automation as it grows from one job, to ten, to one hundred. Finally, you’ll learn how to create your entire Jenkins job collection from scratch, at the push of a button.
